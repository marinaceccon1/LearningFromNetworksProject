# LearningFromNetworksProject
Repository of the Larning from Networks project delivered by Marina Ceccon, Laura Meroi, Mattia Pasti.
Each of the notebooks correspond to a combination of approaches and centality metrics:
- Degree_ratio.ipynb contains the computation of the first approach with the degree centrality.
- Betweenness_rato.ipynb contains the computation of the first approach with the betweenness centrality.
- Degree.ipynb contains the computation of the second approach with the degree centrality.
- Betweenness.ipynb contains the computation of the second approach with the betweenness centrality.

The computation of the number of triangles in the graph after adding N random edges can be found in the notebook Degree_ratio.ipynb.
The file "out.txt" contains the edge list of the network, and "bet.txt" the approximation of the betweenness centrality of the nodes, so that one doesn't have to compute it by scratch everytime.
